## User: simple schema with one type
This [example](https://github.com/nodkz/graphql-compose-examples/tree/master/examples/user) has simple User mongoose model that supports bunch of CRUD operations.

```js
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String, // standard types
  age: {
    type: Number,
    index: true,
  },
  languages: {
    type: [LanguagesSchema], // you may include other schemas (here included as array of embedded documents)
    default: [],
  },
  contacts: { // another mongoose way for providing embedded documents
    email: String,
    phones: [String], // array of strings
  },
  gender: { // enum field with values
    type: String,
    enum: ['male', 'female', 'ladyboy'],

## User for Relay: simple schema with one type

This [schema](https://github.com/nodkz/graphql-compose-examples/tree/master/examples/userForRelay) shows all available CRUD operations which are compatible with Relay. It uses `graphql-compose-mongose` and `graphql-compose-relay`:
- `composeWithRelay(RootQueryTC)` adds `node` field to the RootQuery. Via `RootQuery.node(id)` you may find objects by globally unique ID among all types.
- `composeWithRelay(UserTC)` - modify `UserTC` generated by `graphql-compose-mongoose`  
  - adds `id` field with Relay's globally unique ID
  - this type will be added to `NodeInterface` for resolving via `RootQuery.node`
  - for mutations will be added `clientMutationId` to input and output objects types
  - also all arguments in mutations will be moved into `input` arg
